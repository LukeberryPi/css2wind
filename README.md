## Accessing locally

You need to have these installed:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

If you don't have one, it is recommended that you also download an IDE:

- [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Then, you can:

- [clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) if you just want to look around
- [fork this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) if you want to contribue code and open pull requests

Now, access the directory to which you just cloned the repository:

`cd css2wind`

Finally, you should install dependencies:

`npm install`

And build the website:

`npm run dev`

Now, this url should be running css2wind locally!

[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
